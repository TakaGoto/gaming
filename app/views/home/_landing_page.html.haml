    %h2 Our Goal
    %h5 So much to say, but I know gamers hate reading so lets straight to the point.  Obviously I'll put a TL;DR at the end for those who hate reading with a passion.

    %h5 This website is built from the bottom up, no templates, no Wordpress.  This means that anything is possible, its 100% customizable.  We want to build a website that's made for Chicago Gamers.  I'm positive everyone has had moments where they wish a website had a feature.  Personally, I wish Twitch would pinpont streamers from Chicago.  I rather watch Kenny Capulong than some random "profesional" gamer.  I wish they bring facebook chat rooms back for facebook groups.  They disabled them because the group was getting too big.  At the moment the features we're about to implement are only the beginning.  We listen to the community, and we take actions.  Give us feedback, we take criticism with a smile.  We want this website to be the Cornerstone of a big Gaming Community, the one place to go for everything we need to be involved.

    %p TL;DR Website for Chicago Gamers.  Give us feedback, and we'll do our best.
